# Adding an Important To Me bar to a Connections component {#concept_ytd_hr1_hbb .concept}

Use an iframe to add an Important to Me \(ITM\) bar to any Connections component.

This approach has several advantages.

-   The bar implementation is isolated from the component page implementation, so you don't have to worry about issues like library conflict.
-   The HTML in the frame is unaffected by the CSS that controls the rest of the page.
-   The iframe provides cross domain support.
-   The implementation detail is hidden, so adding the bar is easy.
