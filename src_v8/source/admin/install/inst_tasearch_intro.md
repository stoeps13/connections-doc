# Setting up type-ahead search {#inst_tasearch_intro .task}

Enable type-ahead search in HCL Connections™ to suggest items in the search box based on content that is relevant to each user.

To configure type-ahead search, use the instructions that are most appropriate to your Connections deployment.

-   **[Managing the OpenSearch index for Connections type-ahead search](../install/inst_managing_os_index_cnx_typeahead_search.md)**  
The Connections type-ahead search feature uses an index named “quickresults” within the OpenSearch search engine. Review the following information about this index, preferably before creating the quickresults index and enabling the type-ahead search capability.
-   **[Setting up certificates for type-ahead search](../install/inst_tasearch_no_metrics.md)**  
If you deployed OpenSearch in your HCL Connections deployment, use these instructions to set up certificates before you configure type-ahead search.
