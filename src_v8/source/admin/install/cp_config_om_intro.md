# Configuring the Orient Me component {#cp_config_om_intro. .concept}

Additional configuration is required for the Orient Me component to populate it with Connections data and to enable the notification center and a menu option for managing home pages.

**Note:** Orient Me is only supported in the Connections 7.0 user interface.
