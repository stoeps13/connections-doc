# Configuring additional HCL Connections applications {#t_inst_config_addons .task}

You must perform additional tasks to enable type-ahead search, Customizer Lite, and Community Surveys in HCL Connections.

-   **[Setting up type-ahead search](../install/inst_tasearch_intro.md)**  
Enable type-ahead search in HCL Connections™ to suggest items in the search box based on content that is relevant to each user.
-   **[Installing Customizer Lite](../install/cp_install_customizer_lite.md)**  
This topic describes how to install Customizer Lite. There are two deployment options, hereby referred to as Customizer Lite and Customizer Lite HA. Customizer Lite – the most basic deployment using a single Docker node running a single instance of each required service and Customizer Lite HA – a more resilient deployment using a pair \(or more\) of Docker nodes all running instances of each required service with requests load balanced across available nodes.
