## Support for Connections 7.0 user interface \(UI\) {#section_n1w_dzf_hvb .section}

For a Connections 7.0 deployment \(with or without Component Pack installed\), only the new gender-neutral profile avatar images are available â€“ no other Connections 8.0 features are supported.

**Note:**

-   The Connections 7.0 UI is temporarily supported to aid in the transition to Connections 8.0.
-   The default UI for Connections 8.0 depends on your deployment method. A fresh installation will have the 8.0 UI, while an upgrade will have the 7.0 UI enabled by default. If you want to get the new user experience after upgrading to Connections 8.0, you need to manually switch to the 8.0 interface.
