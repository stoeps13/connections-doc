# Accessibility features for Connections {#accessibility_topic .concept}

Accessibility features assist users who have a disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use information technology content successfully.

## Accessibility features { .section}

HCL Connectionsâ„¢ includes the following major accessibility features:

-   Keyboard-only operation
-   Operations that use a screen reader
-   Keys that are discernible by touch but do not activate just by touching them
-   Industry-standard devices for ports and connectors
-   The attachment of alternative input and output devices
-   Screen magnification

HCL Connections uses the latest W3C Standard, [WAI-ARIA 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) \([http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)\), to ensure compliance to[US Section 508](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/section-508-standards), and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). To take advantage of accessibility features, use the latest release of your screen reader in combination with the latest web browser that is supported by this product.

## Keyboard navigation { .section}

Most keyboards have a **Menu** key, otherwise known as an **Apps** key, that functions as right-click. JAWS specifies the key combination of NUMPAD STAR for this purpose.

To display a person's business card, press **Enter** on the user name link to open the business card. Focus moves to the Profile element in the business card.

For JAWS users: To activate buttons in the user interface, press the **Enter** key, even when JAWS announces to use the space bar.

In the HCL Connections navigation bar, apps and the user image launch dialogs. Use the **Tab** key to navigate through the options.

## Interface information { .section}

The HCL Connections user interfaces do not have content that flashes 2 - 55 times per second.

The HCL Connections web user interfaces rely on cascading style sheets to render content properly and to provide a usable experience. The application provides an equivalent way for low-vision users to use a user's system display settings, including high-contrast mode. You can control font size by using the device or web browser settings.

The HCL Connections web user interface includes WAI-ARIA navigational landmarks that you can use to quickly navigate to functional areas in the application.
