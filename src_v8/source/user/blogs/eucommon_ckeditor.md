# Using the rich text editor {#eucommon_ckeditor .concept}

Use the rich text editor to create visually interesting blog posts, wiki articles, forum topics, and activity entries. The rich text editor is also used in Communities, Events, and Profiles.

**Note:** This topic describes the default rich text editor in Connections, but your organization might have implemented one of the Ephox editors, EditLive! or Textbox.io.

Use the rich text editor to enter and format text or to insert images and links. Depending on the application that you are using and how it is configured, some features of the editor might not be available. For example, you can insert an Adobeâ„¢ Flash movie into a blog entry but this capability is not available in a forum topic.

In most browsers, you can spell-check words in the editor by selecting the words and then simultaneously pressing **Ctrl** and right-clicking the mouse.

In the editor, hover your mouse cursor over an icon for a label that describes the feature. The following table describes some of the more advanced features available in the editor.

|Icon|Feature description|
|----|-------------------|

|Paste content. The **Paste** menu item provides a way of pasting content if your browser security prevents you from pasting content from the clipboard. The **Paste as plain text** menu item provides a way of removing formatting from the pasted content and then inserting it into the document. In both cases, use the keyboard to paste the content into the dialog and then click **OK** to insert it into the page.

-   Use table headers to help keep the table organized.
-   To fill the page, set the table width to 99%.
-   To delete a table, right-click it and select **Delete Table**.
