## Adding an image { .section}

The easiest way to add an image is to paste an image into your wiki page, or drag and drop an image file from your local system to the **Rich Text** editor. Or, you can add an image from your local file system, a webpage, or a file attachment that you already uploaded:

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Wikis** and select the wiki you want to work on.
2.  Select the page you want to edit, and then click **Edit**.
3.  In the **Rich Text** editor, place the cursor where you want the image to be displayed.
4.  Click the **Insert/Edit Image** icon ![Insert or edit image icon](images/insert_image.png) in the editor toolbar.
5.  Select an image from your local files, enter the URL of an image file, or add an existing image.

## Adding a video { .section}

If you have the URL of a Flash movie, link directly to it. A Flash movie usually has a \*.swf file extension. Or link to an embedded video, such as a YouTube video, by embedding the video code in your HTML code.
