# Long description for the planning an event image {#concept_och_gxh_my .concept}

The image is a screenshot of a mock activity. The callout for the title and activity goal suggests putting "the event details in the title and goal. A word or two of instructions helps your members get started." The rest of the activity is broken into five sections: food, drinks, dessert, entertainment, and other. The food and dessert sections are expanded to show a mock conversation about who is bringing what. The callout for the food section states, "Use sections to organize and separate all the different aspects of your event." Another callout points to the expanded dessert section, reminding you to "post questions as entries, so members can comment and decide what to bring."
