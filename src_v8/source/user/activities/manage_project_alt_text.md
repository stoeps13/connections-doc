# Long description for the coordinating a project image {#concept_xn2_dwh_my .concept}

The image is a screenshot of a mock activity. The callout for the title and activity goal suggests letting "your team know the purpose of your activity in the title and goal." The rest of the activity is broken into four sections: meeting minutes and schedule, assignments, shared resources, and Q & A. The assignments and Q & A sections are expanded to show a mock conversation about who should do what. The callout for the assignments section states, "Track all those moving parts with to-do items. Assign them to your team and add due dates." One of the items is checked off with a line going through it. Another callout points to the section titles, reminding you to "group like content into sections." The last callout refers to the expanded region under Q & A, where responses are staggered based on type. The callout reads, "Make the most of your discussions with entries and comments."
