# Refining the bookmarks list {#filterthebookmarklist .task}

Filter the list of bookmarks to view all the public bookmarks created by another person, or to view all bookmarks associated with a specific tag. Choose a sort criteria.

Use these techniques to filter and sort bookmarks:

-   Display **Public Bookmarks** or **Popular** bookmarks. Popular bookmarks show bookmarks that are created most often and the most visited bookmarks.
-   Change the sort order by clicking **Date** or **Popularity**. Clicking either button again toggles the sort order between ascending and descending order.
-   Filter the bookmark list in **Public Bookmarks** or **Popular** by clicking a tag or a person's name or searching for a tag or person's name to see bookmarks associated with that tag or person.

    **Note:** You can filter by both tag and person name to create a very specific search. For example, you can search on the tag rebates and then find bookmarks with that tag created by Samantha Daryn.
