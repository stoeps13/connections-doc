# Reviewing draft files {#t_com_library_review_drafts .task}

When you are selected as a reviewer for library files, you must approve new or updated files before they are published to the library.

By default, all designated reviewers must approve file drafts before they are published to the library.

1.  To review a library file, complete the following steps.
2.  Browse to the file that is pending your review.

    You can access the files that you must review by opening the library from the community navigation and selecting **Review Requests** from the **Show** list.

3.  Click **Download** to download and review the file.

4.  When you review the file, do one of the following:

    -   To approve the file and publish it to the community, click **Approve**. Click **Leave an optional comment for the Editors** to share more comments with your fellow reviewers before you click **Approve** again.
    -   To return the file to the file owner to be updated, click **Reject**. Click **Leave an optional comment for the Editors** to share more comments with your fellow reviewers before you click **Reject** again.
    -   To stop the review of a draft, click **Stop Review**. Stopping a review allows for additional changes to be made, and saves current review comments and history to the draft. Enter a comment in the **Comment** field and then click **Stop Review**.
