# Managing a community library {#t_com_library_manage .task}

Control the level of access that members have to your community library using roles. You can also enable draft review functionality so that selected members must approve files before they are published to the library.

In addition to specifying access levels and enabling a document review cycle, community owners can edit library settings to choose a different sorting order for the library compact view and change the default document type for community libraries.

1.  Perform these steps to manage your community library.
2.  From the community's Overview page, select **Community Actions** \> **Edit Community**.

3.  Click the **Library** tab and complete one or more of the following tasks:

    -   To change the level of access that community members have to library files, select a role from the **Roles** section.

        **Note:** Community members have at least reader and contributor access to all files and folders respectively, by default, but file authors and community owners can change sharing settings for individual files. For more information, see [Sharing library files and folders](t_com_library_sharing.md).

    -   To change the sorting order of the compact display, select a column order and sort order in the **Document list sort section**.
    -   To change the default document type set for the library, click **Change** in the **Document types** section, select a document type, and then click **OK**.
    -   To allow members to change the document type for individual files, select the **Allow members to change the default Document Type on files added to this Library app** check box.
    -   To enable a draft review cycle for library files:
        1.  Select **Require review** in the **Draft Review** section.
        2.  Enter the names of one or more reviewers in the **Add Reviewers** field.
        3.  To specify that only one review is needed before a file can be uploaded, click the **Only one Reviewer must review** check box.
        4.  To specify that the person submitting a file can add reviewers, click the **Allow draft submitter to add Reviewers** check box.
4.  Click **Save and Close** to apply your changes.
