# Linking a Box app to a Box folder {#t_com_add_widgets .task}

Configure a Box app to link to a Box folder so that community members can store and retrieve files.

You must add the Box app to your community before you link it to a Box folder. For more information, see [Adding apps to your Community](c_com_add_widgets.md)

**Note:** Box folder access control and community membership are not synchronized. That is, when you add a Box app and bind a folder to the community, you must also add the community members to the access control list \(ACL\) of the folder. Therefore, when you add a new user to a community, you must also add them to the ACL of the folder. The folder owner can also change the access control list of the folder independently of the community.

You must be a registered Box user before you can link a Box app to a Box folder. For more information, go to your organization's Box URL.

Work with Box files and folders from within a community by using the Box app.

1.  To link to a Box folder from within your Community, complete the following steps.
2.  Select the Box app that you want to work with on the community's **Overview** page.

3.  Click **Select a Box folder**.

    **Note:** If you are not already logged on to Box, you might see a Box-specific login request. Alternatively, you might be redirected to your organization's Box login page. You might also be asked to confirm your credentials several times.

4.  Select the folder that you want to link to from the Box File Picker window and click **Choose**.


The Box folder that you selected is displayed in the Box app on the Community Overview page. You can now use Box's file storage manipulation and retrieval utilities from within your Community. The Box app in the community is also renamed to reflect the new folder.
