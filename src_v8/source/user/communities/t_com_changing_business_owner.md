# Changing the business owner of a community {#t_com_changing_business_owner .task}

You must be the current business owner to transfer business ownership of a community to another member.

The person who creates a community is the business owner of the community and any subcommunities with the community. Each community must have a business owner and it can have only one business owner. The business owner can perform any of the actions that a community owner can. The business owner can also transfer the business owner role to another community member with an active account. The member must be a member of the same organization.

**Note:** You cannot transfer business ownership to a guest member of the community, and a guest who is a business owner cannot transfer business ownership.

1.  From the navigation bar, click **Communities** and select the community that you want to manage.

2.  In the community menu, click **Members**.

3.  If your community is large and you know the member’s name, click in the **Find a Member** box and start typing the member’s name. Type-ahead filters the names in the organization’s directory.

4.  Click **Edit** for the member whose role you want to change to business owner.

5.  Select **Business Owner**, and then click **Save**.


Your role has been changed to owner, and the member that you selected is now the business owner.
