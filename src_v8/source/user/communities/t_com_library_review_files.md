# Working with draft files {#t_com_library_review_files .concept}

Community owners can edit library settings to require that all new and updated files must be reviewed and approved by specific users or groups. When new or updated files are approved, they can be published to the library.

When draft review is enabled for a library, by default all designated reviewers must approve draft files before they are published to the community. If one reviewer rejects the file, the file status shows as rejected, and the other reviewers are no longer required to review the file.

When a community member checks a file into a library that requires draft reviews, the file is locked. The file owner can cancel the draft review to revise file content and resubmit an updated draft.

File reviewers are notified when draft files are submitted for review. If they approve a draft, the file is published to the library and is unlocked. If the file is rejected following review, the file owner must accept the rejection by clicking the **Stop Review** option. When the file owner stops the review, the file is unlocked and the owner can continue updating the draft. If the file owner wants to remove the draft, it can be deleted after the owner stops the review.
