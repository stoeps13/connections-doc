# Adding files to a library {#howdoiaddnewdocuments .task}

Add files to your library or create new files to share them with community members.

If the community owner specifies that files must be reviewed before they are uploaded to the library, you must save the files as drafts. You can then submit them for review before you upload to the library.

1.  To upload files to a library, complete the following steps:
2.  Open the library and the folder where you want to upload the file.

3.  Upload flies by using either the **Manual files upload** or the **Drag-and-drop** method:

    1.  To manually upload files, click **Upload Files** and then click **Browse** to select the files to upload.

    2.  Import files from your operating system by directly dragging files into your browser.

4.  Select one of the following options:

    1.  Click **Check In** to upload the file and make it available to library users.

    2.  Click **Save as Draft** to upload the file as a draft. Only you can see and work with your drafts. To check in a draft, open the file page and click **Check In**.

5.  If HCL Connectionsâ„¢ Docs is deployed, you can create new files directly within a library. To use HCL Docs to add new files to a library, complete the following steps:
6.  Open the library and the folder where you want to upload the file.

7.  Click **New** and then select either **Document**, **Spreadsheet** or **Presentation** depending on the type of file you want to add.

8.  Enter a file name for the file.

9.  Optional: Set the tags, description, and document type for the file.

10. Click **Create**. The file is now created and opened for editing in HCL Docs.

    **Note:** The format of the file that is created depends on your HCL Docs file format preferences. For more information, see [http://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v65/using/text/document/d\_changing\_the\_default\_file\_format.dita](http://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v65/using/text/document/d_changing_the_default_file_format.dita).


If you saved your file as a draft, you must submit the file for review before it can be published to the library. Open the file summary page and click **Submit for Review**.
