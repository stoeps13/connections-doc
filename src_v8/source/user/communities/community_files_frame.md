# Sharing information in community files {#community_files_frame .reference}

Upload, manage, organize, and collaborate on community files with ease.

## Working with files {#section_i4y_1ny_b5b .section}

You can manage content using community files in the following ways:

-   **Lock files**. Prevent other users from updating selected files.
-   **Version control**. Quickly see who updated the content and roll back to previous file versions.
-   **File organization**. Copy, move, and delete files, and use the **Trash** view to manage deleted content.
-   **Draft review**. Members can collaborate on shared files and send them through an established review cycle to obtain the approval of selected members of the community.
-   **Sharing**. Community owners can set the level of access to files for all community members, giving tighter control over who can edit content.
-   **Social content management**. For example, use tags to categorize content and improve file retrieval, and like files to recommend them to fellow members.
-   **Engagement**. @Mention other users in comments on documents.
