# Sharing library files and folders {#t_com_library_sharing .task}

Update sharing settings for library files and folders to control how community members access them. To view the current sharing status, click the **Sharing** tab on the summary page for the file or folder.

By default, an uploaded file is shared with people who have access to the library or folder where the file is uploaded. You can change the default access for a file or folder by sharing it explicitly with others.

To set the default sharing settings for a library ask your administrator to enable the **Change sharing on Library settings** feature.

1.  To update sharing settings for a library file or folder, complete the following steps.
2.  Open the library that contains the file or folder for which you want to update settings.

3.  Complete one of the following steps:

    -   To change settings for a file, click the name of the file that you want to share, and select **More Actions** \> **Share**.
    -   To change settings for a folder, click **More** next to the folder that you want to share and then click **Share**.

    -   Specific individuals, ensure that **a Member** is selected from the **Share with** list, and then enter one or more names in the text field provided.

        **Note:** If groups are enabled for your organization, you cannot add an individual user to a role that is below, or the same role as group they are included in.

    -   A group, select **a Group** from the **Share with** list, and then enter the name of the group in the field provided.
    -   All community members, select **Community Members** from the **Share with** list, select the access level that you want members to have, and click **Add**.
    -   Everyone, including non-community members, select **Everyone \(public\)** from the **Share with** list, ensure that the appropriate access level is showing, and click **Add**.

        **Note:** This option is only available for public communities.

    -   A library, select the **Sharing** tab on the library level, and select **Change sharing on Library settings**. You can then use the library edit mode of the app to change sharing settings at the library level.

        **Note:** If you do not see the **Sharing** control on an individual library, ask your administrator to enable it.
