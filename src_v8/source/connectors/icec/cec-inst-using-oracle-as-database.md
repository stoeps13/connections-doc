# Using Oracle as database {#id_name .reference}

Follow these steps for creating an Oracle database and an Oracle JDBC provider.

-   **[Creating an Oracle database](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-create-oracle-database.md)**  
An SQL script file is included for each supported RDBMS in the Connections Engagement Center zip file. The SQL scripts can be found in the subdirectory **SQLScripts**.
-   **[Creating an Oracle JDBC provider \(optional\)](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-create-oracle-jdbc-provider.md)**  
You can skip these steps if you elect to use the default JDBC provider that Connections Activities uses. The Activities JDBC provider is used as the default in the install.properties file when you install the Connections Engagement Center. If you want to have a clear separation for the Connections Engagement Center database, follow these instructions.
