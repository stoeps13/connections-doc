# Creating a database {#reference_ery_k3q_h1b .reference}

Connections Engagement Center provides SQL scripts to create a database. Before you begin, download and extract the installation files to a local directory such as /opt/software/XCC-Installer. Then follow the instructions in this section for creating a database using DB2, MSSQL, or Oracle.

-   **[Using DB2 as a database](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-using-db2-database.md)**  
You must be logged in into the operating system as DB2 administrator when you create the database, typically as **db2admin**.
-   **[Using MSSQL as a database](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-using-mssql-database.md)**  
Follow these steps for creating an MSSQL database and an MSSQL JDBC provider.
-   **[Using Oracle as database](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-using-oracle-as-database.md)**  
Follow these steps for creating an Oracle database and an Oracle JDBC provider.
-   **[Migrating a database](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-database-migration.md)**  
You can migrate each supported database to another supported database. Sometimes you also want to have a new environment. For example, when you want to upgrade HCL Connections. Therefore, you don't need to work on the database, you only need to work with the user interface of Connections Engagement Center.
