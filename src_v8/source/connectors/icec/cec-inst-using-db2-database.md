Included is a SQL script file for each supported RDBMS into the Connections Engagement Center Release Package zip file. The SQL scripts can be found in the subdirectory SQLScripts.
-   **[Creating a DB2 database for Linux](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-create-db2-linux.md)**  
Create a DB2 database for Linux \(single and multiple instances\).
-   **[Creating a DB2 JDBC provider \(optional\)](../../connectors/icec/cec-inst-create-db2-jdbc.md)**  
You can skip these steps if you elect to use the default JDBC provider that Connections Activities uses. The Activities JDBC provider is used as the default in the install.properties file when you install the Connections Engagement Center. If you want to have a clear separation for the Connections Engagement Center database, follow these instructions.
