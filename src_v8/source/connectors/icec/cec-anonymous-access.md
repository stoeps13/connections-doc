# Anonymous access {#id_name .reference}

Please make sure, that you configured the Connections Engagement Center for anonymous access.

External Users can access the Connections Engagement Center page with the following URL: `www.yourDomain.com/xcc/global?page=yourXCCpage`

You will have some limitations in the anonymous mode. E.g. you will not have Connections-widget, a Connections header or the RightColumn or Activitystream. Also some of the Connections Engagement Center widgets will not appear in the anonymous mode. These widgets are documented here at the chapter ?Connections Engagement Center widgets?.

It is not possible to like or comment on blog posts or wiki entries.

**Note:** Anonymous access is not developed as an internet solution. Please use it only for your intranet solution.
