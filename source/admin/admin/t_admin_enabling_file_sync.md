# Enabling sync for files and folders {#t_admin_enabling_file_sync .task}

Enable sync for files and folders in the Files application. This feature enhances collaboration by allowing users to keep files and folders synchronized even when working offline.

Sync is available on the client by default, but is only visible when users connect to a site that also has sync enabled. Being able to synchronize files is dependent on the desktop plug-ins being installed on users' clients.

**Attention:** Sync should be configured before the desktop clients are configured. If sync is configured after the desktop client plug-ins, users will have to refresh their server configuration manually.

!!! note
    Users can sync folders as well as files using My Drive. My Drive is available to users regardless of whether the file sync folder from a previous version of HCL Connections is available. When file sync is enabled, all files and folders in a user's My Drive will be synced to their My Drive folder on their desktop.

1.  To ensure that sync is enabled in Files, perform the following steps:
2.  Check out files-config.xml by following the first two steps described in [Changing Files configuration property values](t_admin_files_changing_config_properties.md).

3.  Locate the `fileSync` section in the files-config.xml file as follows:

    ```
    <fileSync enabled="true">
    <clientDownloadLink enabled="true" url="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/ibm/connections/IBMConnectionsMSDesktop.zip">
    <clientPlatform enabled="true" id="win" url="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/ibm/connections/IBMConnectionsMSDesktop.zip"/>
    <clientPlatform enabled="true" id="mac" url="http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/ibm/connections/IBMConnectionsMac.zip"/>
    </clientDownloadLink>
    <autoVersioning enabled="true"/>
    </fileSync>
    ```

    Where

    -   The `clientDownloadLink` URL must be the valid URL to download the file sync client.
    -   The `versioning` setting must be enabled.
    -   The `autoVersioning` setting must be enabled to avoid generating too many versions.
4.  Check in files-config.xml by following the first three steps described in [Applying Files property changes](t_admin_files_config_apply.md).

5.  Make sure the filesync-user alias is mapped to correct users as follows:

    1.  From the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, navigate to **Applications** \> **Application Types** \> **Websphere enterprise applications**. In this view, click **Files** to go to the **Configuration** tab, select **Security role to user/group mapping**.
    2.  Make sure filesync-user is mapped to the correct users. You can choose to map to specific users/groups, or simply map it to All Authenticated in Application's Realm.
6.  Configure throttling for sync.

    The default value is set to 50, the maximum number of concurrent requests that are allowed on one WebSphere node to handle file synchronization requests.

    1.  Open the LotusConnections-config.xml and add or change the value for this setting based on your needs

        ```
        <properties>
                 <genericProperty name="com.ibm.lconn.files.api.throttler.filesync">50</genericProperty>
             </properties>
        ```

        !!! note
    You might consider starting with a value that is 1/3 of the total of Web Container thread to limit the maximum number of concurrent file sync requests. It also can be used to ensure that enough threads are available to service web application requests and typical file upload and download activity.

7.  By enabling Push Notification technology, the file sync feature scales to multiple clients and the clients can update their content faster when changes are made on the server. The clients detect the availability of the push service automatically. If you want to use push technology for file sync, the server configuration needs to be changed . The Push Notification service must be enabled in general and the specific configuration items for file sync must be enabled too.

    1.  To enable the Push Notification service, change in LotusConnections-Config.xml. For example:

        ```
         <sloc:serviceReference bootstrapHost="admin_replace" bootstrapPort="admin_replace"
              clusterName="" enabled="true" serviceName="pushnotification"
                ssl_enabled="true">         <sloc:href>
                          <sloc:hrefPathPrefix>/push</sloc:hrefPathPrefix>
                          <sloc:static href="admin_replace" ssl_href="admin_replace"/>
                          <sloc:interService href="admin_replace"/>        
              </sloc:href>     </sloc:serviceReference>
        ```

    2.  To enable Push Notification specific configuration, change in pushnotification-config.xml. For example:

        ```
        <config id="pushnotification"      
               xmlns="http://www.ibm.com/connections/pushnotification/pushnotification-config/1.0"
                  xmlns:tns="http://www.ibm.com/connections/pushnotification/files-config/1.0"
                  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"      
               xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ibm.com/connections/pushnotification/pushnotification-config/1.0
              pushnotification-config.xsd">    <cache>            <user timeout="3600000" />
                </cache>        <db dialect="DB2" />    <message>    
                <queue maximumAgeInHours="720"/>      
               </message>    <scheduledTasks>            <task name="MessagePrunning" interval="0 0
              0-23/3 * * ?|0 30 1-23/3 * * ?" enabled="false" type="internal"/>      
               </scheduledTasks>    <server>            <bayeuxServer logLevel="3"/>          
               <transports timeout="60000" interval="0" metaConnectDeliverOnly="true"
              maxQueue="-1"/>        </server>
        </config>
        ```

        !!! note
    When the previous configuration items are changed, restart the Push Notifications and Files applications.

8.  If you changed the sync setting, restart the Files application.
