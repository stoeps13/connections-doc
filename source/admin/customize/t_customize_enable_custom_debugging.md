# Enabling live user interface customization editing mode {#t_customize_enable_custom_debugging .task}

You can force applications to reload override files every time a browser request is made. This capability shows your customization changes in the product instantly.

**Important:** Do not leave the product in customization debugging mode when you are using it in a production environment. This capability is resource-intensive and has a major impact on product performance. Use debugging mode only when you are making and testing changes to the user interface during the testing phase. Ensure that you disable this feature after you validate your customizations. If you forget to disable customization debugging, an error is written to the log to remind you.

1.  To turn on the customization debugging capability, add a WebSphere® Application Server environment variable named CONNECTIONS\_CUSTOMIZATION\_DEBUG and set it to true.

    1.  Open the IBM® WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solutions Console, expand **Environment**, and then click **WebSphere variables**.

    2.  In the Scope section, select cell 1 from the list, and then click **New**.

    3.  Type the following values into the fields:

        Name
        :   CONNECTIONS\_CUSTOMIZATION\_DEBUG

        Value
        :   true

    4.  Click **Apply**, and then **OK** to return to the previous page.
