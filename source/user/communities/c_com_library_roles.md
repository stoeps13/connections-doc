!!! note
    Members of the Community Owners group can perform this action; it is not related to having the owner role for any item inside the library.


 !!! note
    Community owners always have the owner role, and have access to all library files and folders. When someone creates a file or folder, community owners are automatically added as owners of that file or folder. Community owners cannot be modified.

Users who are community owners can also perform management tasks for libraries. For more information see, [Owners - manage your community effectively](community_owners.md).
