## Supported image files {#section_tfs_2ts_sy .section}

You can add any image file format that is supported by your browser. The most widely supported image formats are BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, and RAW

!!! note
    This function differs across applications. In most applications, for example, it is not possible to upload an image from your computer, paste an image, nor use an attached image that you already uploaded. Those abilities are supported in Blogs, Forums, and Wikis only. Moreover, pasting an image is supported in the Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers only; it is not supported in Internet Explorer.

3.  Click the **Insert Image** icon in the editor toolbar.
4.  Enter the following information about the image:

    URL
    :   The URL where the image file is located. If the image is on an external server, use the full address; for example: http://example.com/image.png. If the image is on the same server as the Connections application, use a relative path; for example: /images/image.png.
