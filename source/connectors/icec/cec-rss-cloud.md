# RSS Feed {#concept_y44_mdk_rdb .concept}

This widget allows you to include elements from other web sites. You can show RSS or ATOM Feeds from external sites within that widget.

!!! note
    Be sure to configure the RSS Feed widget to work with the Connections Cloud approved proxies. For more information, see [Configuring a whitelist for the proxy server](cec-rss-cloud-configure.md).

The RSS widget includes a Rich RSS option that allows displaying images from the target resources within the RSS widget. The Rich RSS option will not work for all RSS widgets.

The RSS widget allows for personalizing the pulled feeds.
