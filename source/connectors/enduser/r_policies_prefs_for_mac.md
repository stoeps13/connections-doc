# Policies and preferences for HCL Connections for Mac {#r_policies_prefs_for_Mac .reference}

Set preferences and policies to control how users interact with HCL Connections for Mac.

## Preference and policy settings { .section}

The following table shows preference and policy settings that control the behavior of IBM® Connections for Mac. You can specify these custom setting by adding or editing keys in property list \(plist\) for the application. Setting values to anything other than the values listed in the table produces unpredictable results.

There are three ways to set a property in a plist.

-   A user can edit the plist in /Users/\{USER\_NAME\}/Library/Preferences/com.ibm.AutoSyncMonitor.plist" using an editor such as xcode or plistBuddy. Create a dictionary with the name of "Policies" and add policies to the dictionary XML file to enable them.

    !!! note
    the debugMode and LogEnabled keys must be added to /Root not /Policies.

-   If you are a local administrator, you can create a new plist namedcom.ibm.AutoSyncMonitor.plist and add it to /Library/Preferences. Add policies to this plist that will apply for users of this computer.

    !!! note
    Once the plist is in this directory the only way to edit it is with plist Buddy and you must authenticate using your administrator password.

-   If you are a server administrator, you can use a program such as OS X Server to distribute custom plists with policies that you set. Add a plist to /Library/Managed Preferences/\{USER\_NAME\}/. The policies apply for each user that you specify. These settings can not be changed locally.

!!! note
    If there is a conflict between the plists, the Managed Preference list on the server override the library and user preferences, and library preferences override user preferences.
